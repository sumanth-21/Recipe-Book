## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Design the concept for my Recipe Box web app went smoothly. I was able to define user roles, outline user stories, and establish a clear vision for the project.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

One challenge I faced was ensuring that my user stories were aligned with the database tables and features I planned to implement. It required some revisiting and refining to make sure everything was cohesive. The main issue was that I wasn't added to a group on time and now after the deadline though I was added to a group, I'm not able hear back from the group members.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

 Having a mentor or resources to consult when facing specific challenges would contribute to the success of my final project.
